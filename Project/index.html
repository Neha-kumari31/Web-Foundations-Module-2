            taken me through some very unconventional routes including working
            as a river guide and naturalist in Grand Teton and Yellostone
            National Parks. I rediscovered my love for computers and I have not
            looked back. I enjoy working on all parts of the tech stack, I am
            just as comfortable writing CSS as I am writing SQL."
